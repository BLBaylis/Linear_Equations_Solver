# Linear Equations Solver
A java program for solving systems f linear equations

This is a project idea from Hyperskill.org.  This Java program takes a N x M size matrix from an input file specified by command line arguments and then outputs the solution in a specified output file.  It works for real numbers and complex numbers.
